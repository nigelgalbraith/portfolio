# Hi, I’m Nigel

I build tools because I like understanding how things actually work.

Most of my projects start the same way:
I hit a problem, I don’t like the messy solution, and I decide to build something cleaner.

I prefer modular systems over giant scripts.
I prefer predictable execution over clever hacks.
I like when structure makes things easier to reason about.
I care more about correctness and clarity than speed or hype.

This portfolio is a collection of the systems I’ve built while learning, experimenting, and refining how I think about software.

Nothing here is flashy for the sake of it.
It’s built to work, to be understandable, and to be reusable.

## What I Work On

You’ll find projects here involving:

- Python tooling and backend services
- Dockerized applications
- Static site generation and automation
- Data transformation and structured analysis
- System configuration and automation scripts

Most of them share the same philosophy:

- Small, single-responsibility components
- Configuration instead of hardcoding
- Clear separation between data and logic
- Reproducible execution

## Why I Build This Way

I don’t like hidden behaviour.

I don’t like systems that only make sense to the person who wrote them.

I want tools that:

- Can be read later and still make sense
- Can be extended without breaking everything
- Make their structure obvious

## Current Focus

Right now I’m refining:

- Backend systems
- Structured data tooling
- Automation projects
- Security lab experimentation

Everything is MIT licensed.

If something is useful, copy it.
Change it. Break it. Improve it.
