1,Page 5/6,"To meet and prepare for these challenges NSW Health must change the
way it delivers services. NSW Health is implementing a major combined
clinical and corporate and ICT reform program to address these issues.
Implementation of IT solutions to support staff and embed business
processes is critical to ensuring change to delivery of services is
sustainable. To be successful this requires a change in the way that ICT
solutions are procured, designed and implemented.
Historic investment decisions and decision-making have resulted in Area
Health Services developing disparate clinical and corporate applications,
supporting mixed infrastructure and integration approaches. This has
resulted in:
• Very high integration cost and difficulty gaining a comprehensive
clinical or management information;
• Duplication of effort and little reuse of technology assets;
• Existence of information gaps and overlaps;
• Different clinical specialty systems making it difficult to effectively
manage the patient journey and give clinicians a single view of their
patients;
• Twenty-nine systems support basic HR functions;
• Systems that are more than 20 years old and have limited support.","NSW Health is changing how it does things to meet challenges. They're putting in a big program to fix clinical, corporate, and tech stuff. Getting the right IT tools is key to making sure these changes last.

2.1 Strategic Themes
In summary, the ICT Strategy revolves around three strategic themes:
• Significantly improved support for clinicians and patient care
• Strategic alignment to major NSW Health initiatives; and
• Considerable cost savings.
These themes are expressed in terms of five Strategic Objectives
1. Use of ICT to enable major clinical reform programs;
2. Reduce the duplication and cost in administrative systems
3. Deliver a core set of high quality information to all levels of the
organisation
4. Build an ICT Infrastructure that is available and responsive and
supports the requirements of the clinical and corporate systems
reforms; and
5. Adopt a coordinated, portfolio approach to the management of ICT to
ensure that the maximum benefit is gained from NSW Health’s
investment in ICT","The ICT Strategy is built on three main ideas:
Better support for clinicians and patient care.
Aligning with big NSW Health plans.
Saving a lot of money.

These ideas guide five key objectives:

• The ultimate goal or vision for the community
• The contribution NSW Health will make towards achieving this goal or
vision
• The focus for achieving the goal or vision, including intended
outcomes, risks and strategies
• Strategies for measuring where performance targets have been met
• The cost of achieving the goal or vision and meeting performance
targets.

Reducing risk factors in the population is a major strategic objective for
NSW Health. NSW Health is increasing the focus on health promotion and
preventing illness and implementing strategies to increase immunisation
rates, reduce the impact of chronic disease, reduce diabetes through
interventions for people at high risk. ICT can support many of these
strategies by providing automatic alerts about risk factors, such as gaps in
immunisations, or overdue screening or check ups.'",NSW Health wants to prevent sickness and promote good health habits.

NEHTA’s primary goal is the development of national health information
management and communications technology standards and specifications.
NEHTA is progressing a number of work programs that will have a direct
impact on NSW Health’s ICT strategic plan.
These include:
eHealth interoperability: developing a Framework for Interoperability to
enable efficient and secure electronic exchange of information between
health organisations.
Clinical communications: NEHTA is undertaking a program of
standardisation of key clinical information. It is intended that the format
of, and data contained in, clinical communications such as patient referrals
and hospital discharge summaries will be standardised across all health IT
systems, according to the specifications set by NEHTA. These specifications
will be built upon existing standards, extending these as necessary. This
work includes the establishment of a common, coded clinical language
(clinical terminology).
Unique Healthcare Identifiers – This program is developing a single
National identifier for individuals accessing healthcare services, providers
within the public and private healthcare systems and health organisations.
At least initially, the individual identifier is not expected to be used as the
primary identifier by most jurisdictions.

This phase is characterised by an intense design and build of a prototype,
followed by a series of clinical review sessions. A methodology for the
design and build of SBB content has previously been developed and
utilised. The Fast Track methodology leverages this approach and adds in
the more efficient prototype model. The prototype assists clinicians in
gaining a better understanding of the application and offers the opportunity
to view the process as part of an integrated workflow. This approach
facilitates informed decision-making.","In the Content Development phase, they design and build a prototype, then review it with clinicians.

The implementation phase is designed around the State defined content.
Although this introduces a large amount of content in a single project, it
achieves greater benefit and is more cost effective. The Fast Track Metho
reduces the time, cost and complexity of implementation by using a
standard design with State Build content. Resource constraints and the
extended learning curve to get AHS staff up to speed that were an inherent
part of the old methodology, are minimised by the new approach. The
implementation team assigned to the project have the application
knowledge to build the database. A rapid implementation also eliminates
the inevitable scope creep that occurs during any long IT project.","In the Implementation phase, they're putting in the content decided by the state. Doing it all at once might seem like a lot, but it's the most efficient and cost-effective way. Using the Fast Track Method makes things quicker and cheaper, sticking to a standard design with state content. This means less hassle and less time spent learning for Area Health Services staff.

The SBB uses a maturity model to progressively enhance the functionality
of the application as the experience and expectations of users increase.
The maturity model is based on the following principles:
• All Area Health Services contribute to the development of each version
of the SBB.
• Version 1.0 of any application is implemented as the SBB.
Enhancements can be proposed by any Area Health Service, but must
be endorsed by the majority of members of the Application Advisory
Group (AAG).
• Every Area Health Service has equal weight in the AAG.
• Every proposed change must go through a formal change control
process and be reviewed by the AAG, even those that are specific to
one Area (eg establishing the facility codes for hospitals in that Area).
• The primary function of the AAG is to consider and endorse changes
for each version of the SBB. New versions will be released on an
annual basis.
SBB functionality can be classified as:
• Required core: required content and functionality to support common
business and application functions, including standardised KPIs and
reporting and a consistent user interface for mobile staff. Required
content must be consistent across all implementations.
• Modifiable within guidelines to support area specific clinical processes,
assessments and third party applications
• Localised content where site specific information is required in the build
(eg code table for local facilities)","The SBB uses a maturity model to improve its features over time, with all Area Health Services contributing to each version, changes requiring approval from the majority of the Application Advisory Group, and new versions released annually, featuring required core functions, modifiable features, and local content.","Inclusion & equity
