2. Reduce the duplication and cost in administrative systems

organisation

ensure that the maximum benefit is gained from NSW Health’s
investment in ICT', 'The ICT Strategy is built on three main ideas:
Better support for clinicians and patient care.

Providing top-notch info to everyone in the organization.

annual basis.

business and application functions, including standardised KPIs and
reporting and a consistent user interface for mobile staff. Required
content must be consistent across all implementations.
