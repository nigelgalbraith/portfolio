1	Page 5/6	To meet and prepare for these challenges NSW Health must change the\nway it delivers services. NSW Health is implementing a major combined\nclinical and corporate and ICT reform program to address these issues.\nImplementation of IT solutions to support staff and embed business\nprocesses is critical to ensuring change to delivery of services is\nsustainable. To be successful this requires a change in the way that ICT\nsolutions are procured, designed and implemented.\nHistoric investment decisions and decision-making have resulted in Area\nHealth Services developing disparate clinical and corporate applications,\nsupporting mixed infrastructure and integration approaches. This has\nresulted in:\n• Very high integration cost and difficulty gaining a comprehensive\nclinical or management information;\n• Duplication of effort and little reuse of technology assets;\n• Existence of information gaps and overlaps;\n• Different clinical specialty systems making it difficult to effectively\nmanage the patient journey and give clinicians a single view of their\npatients;\n• Twenty-nine systems support basic HR functions;\n• Systems that are more than 20 years old and have limited support.	NSW Health is changing how it does things to meet challenges. They're putting in a big program to fix clinical, corporate, and tech stuff. Getting the right IT tools is key to making sure these changes last. Before, they had a mess of different systems which made things harder and more expensive. Plus, some of their systems are ancient and hard to support	\N
2	Page 6	As a result it is difficult to share patient information and coordinate patient\ncare. From a management perspective, it is difficult to obtain accurate\ninformation on system performance. From a financial perspective, the\nsystems are expensive to maintain	Because of all this, it's hard to share patient info and coordinate care properly. Managers struggle to get accurate info on how well the systems are doing. And keeping them running costs a lot of money.	\N
3	Page 6	This situation will undermine the long-term sustainability of the Clinical\nServices Redesign and Corporate Shared Services reform programs. The\nICT program has been realigned and refocussed to meet the long terms\nneeds of the reform program. The focus will be on connecting islands of\ninformation and technology and rapidly supporting clinical and corporate\nreform	This setup could harm the long-term success of the Clinical Services Redesign and Corporate Shared Services. So, they're reshaping the ICT program to fit these reforms better. They're aiming to connect scattered information and tech and quickly support both clinical and corporate changes.	\N
4	Page 6	The Integrated Clinical Information Program (ICIP) was established in 2000\nas a result of recommendations of the NSW Health Council and its objective\nis to deal with the issues outlined above in a defined forward strategy. The\nprogram aims to address these issues by providing core clinical\nfunctionality across NSW. Significant progress has been made in the\nimplementation of patient administration, clinical and corporate systems.	Back in 2000, the Integrated Clinical Information Program (ICIP) started based on advice from the NSW Health Council. Its goal is to fix the problems with a clear plan. The idea is to give essential clinical features to all of NSW. They've already made big strides in setting up patient administration, clinical, and corporate systems	\N
5	Page 8	1.3 Planned outcomes\nThe ICT Strategy has been realigned with the core reform strategies of\nClinical Services Redesign and Corporate Shared Services. Five major ICT\nstrategies have been defined to support these broader strategic priorities.\nThese are the:\n• Clinical Systems Strategy\n• Corporate Systems Strategy\n• Business Information Strategy\n• Sustainable Infrastructure strategy and\n• Whole of Government ICT Strategic directions	Clinical Systems Strategy\nCorporate Systems Strategy\nBusiness Information Strategy\nSustainable Infrastructure Strategy\nWhole of Government ICT Strategic Directions	\N
6	Page 9	Improved quality and safety by ensuring that clinicians have access\nto information they need to provide safe care and by providing systems\nto embed consistent, predictable processes across the state to improve\nquality and safety	They're making care safer and better by giving clinicians the info they need and setting up systems for consistent, predictable processes across the state.	\N
7	Page 9	Improved collaboration within health and other related agencies within NSW, with the private\nsector and nationally to increase interoperability and better information flow to support improved\npatient outcomes and increased efficiency.	They're improving teamwork among health agencies in NSW, as well as with private companies and nationally, so everyone can work together better. This means info flows more smoothly, helping patients and making things more efficient.	\N
8	Page 9	Significant savings – new structures, governance arrangements\nand development and deployment methods \n Rapid deployment of core programs will reduce overall project\nmanagement costs, which are the major cost component\n Potential to integrate with the change management activities\nalready in train with CSRP and Corporate Shared Services, reducing\ncost and increasing value of the change management process.\nThis will also help to embed the ICT processes within the clinical\nand corporate reform programs to ensure that the change is\nsustainable.\n Minimises duration of impact on clinicians in AHS’ and increases the\nspeed to delivery of benefits for clinical care\n Reduced training costs (can train once for all components, not\nmultiple times for each individual component)	They're expecting to save a lot of money by setting up new structures and ways of doing things. By rolling out key programs quickly, they'll spend less on managing projects, and they can piggyback on existing changes to save even more. This also means less disruption for clinicians and patients and less money spent on training.	\N
9	Page 10	2 The ICT Strategic Management Framework\n2.1 Strategic Themes\nIn summary, the ICT Strategy revolves around three strategic themes:\n• Significantly improved support for clinicians and patient care\n• Strategic alignment to major NSW Health initiatives; and\n• Considerable cost savings.\nThese themes are expressed in terms of five Strategic Objectives\n1. Use of ICT to enable major clinical reform programs;\n2. Reduce the duplication and cost in administrative systems\n3. Deliver a core set of high quality information to all levels of the\norganisation\n4. Build an ICT Infrastructure that is available and responsive and\nsupports the requirements of the clinical and corporate systems\nreforms; and\n5. Adopt a coordinated, portfolio approach to the management of ICT to\nensure that the maximum benefit is gained from NSW Health’s\ninvestment in ICT	The ICT Strategy is built on three main ideas:\nBetter support for clinicians and patient care.\nAligning with big NSW Health plans.\nSaving a lot of money.\n\nThese ideas guide five key objectives:\nUsing ICT to drive big changes in clinical care.\nCutting down on duplicated admin systems and costs.\nProviding top-notch info to everyone in the organization.\nSetting up a flexible ICT system that supports both clinical and corporate reforms.\nManaging ICT in a smart, coordinated way to get the most out of the investment.	\N
10	Page 11	2.2 Describing the ICT Strategic Management Framework\nThis document provides the central description of NSW Health’s ICT\nStrategy for the period 2006-2011.\nIt is supported by a number of more specific documents covering:\n• The ICT Asset Management Strategy;\n• NSW Health’s Enterprise Architecture. This document forms the core of\nNSW Health’s ICT Architecture documents, that are specific to:\n The Clinical Systems Architecture\n The Corporate Systems Architecture and Strategy\n The Business Information Strategy\n The Infrastructure Strategy; and\n The Integration architecture strategy\n• The ICT Governance Framework\n• The ICT Portfolio Management and Program of work\n• The ICT Investment Plan 2006-2017.

11	Page 12	The ICT Strategic Plan is driven by the overarching priorities of NSW Health\nas defined by the Results and Services Plan and NSW Health Plan. To\nensure that the ICT portfolio is closely aligned with the RSP and Corporate\nPlan, NSW Health has taken the following steps:\nFrom the RSP:\n• Selected those results and associated services which will be dependent\non the ICT assets working well\n• Identified ICT asset-related risks which may prevent achievement of\nservices and results\n• Identified those services and service measures which will depend on\nthe ICT assets working well.\nFrom the NSW Health Corporate Plan identified:\n• The ultimate goal or vision for the community\n• The contribution NSW Health will make towards achieving this goal or\nvision\n• The focus for achieving the goal or vision, including intended\noutcomes, risks and strategies\n• Strategies for measuring where performance targets have been met\n• The cost of achieving the goal or vision and meeting performance\ntargets.\nThe outcome of this has informed the development of the ICT portfolio\naimed at effectively supporting services needs.	From the RSP:\nThey've picked out results and services that rely on ICT assets.\nThey've identified risks related to ICT assets that could affect service delivery.\nThey've pinpointed services and measures that hinge on ICT assets working properly.\n\nFrom the NSW Health Corporate Plan:\nThey've considered the overall vision for the community.\nThey've outlined how NSW Health will contribute to this vision.\nThey've focused on strategies to achieve goals, along with potential risks.\nThey've set up ways to measure performance and ensure targets are met.\nThey've looked at the costs involved in reaching the vision and meeting targets.	\N
12	Page 13	2.4 Criteria for inclusion in ICT Strategy and Investment\nPlan\nICT priorities are set and reviewed annually. Each initiative is evaluated\nagainst 5 principles to determine the priority of the project and its position\nin the investment program. The principles are:\n• Level of contribution to major service reform agendas and\nalignment with planned NSW Health Results and Services, priorities\nand plans.\n• Extent to which the project supports the patient journey across\nmultiple care settings and improves the quality and safety of health\ncare for the largest number of people.\n• Capacity to deliver improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in\nhealthcare delivery and workforce utilisation.\n• Degree of conformance with state ICT strategic planning\nrequirements.\n• Level of potential to generate a positive return on investment.	Contribution to major service reform agendas and alignment with planned NSW Health priorities and plans.\n    Support for the patient journey across different care settings and improvement of healthcare quality and safety for a large number of people.\n    Ability to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare delivery and workforce utilization.\n    Adherence to state ICT strategic planning requirements.\n    Potential to generate a positive return on investment.	\N
13	Page 13	2.5 Upgrade process\nIt is intended that only new initiatives should be included in the forward\ninvestment program. The ongoing requirement to replace existing systems\nshould be addressed through the procurement and contractual process to\nensure NSW Health has access to future product upgrades through the\nsupport and maintenance agreements formulated with vendors.	They should only add new projects to their investment plan. When it's time to replace old systems, they can handle it through contracts with vendors.	\N
14	Page 14	3 Where we want to be in 2011\nBy 2011 we plan to have implemented the core clinical and corporate\nsystems across NSW to support patient journeys through the health system\nand to provide the corporate systems and management information needed\nto manage the health system efficiently.\nImplementation of the ICT Strategy will deliver benefits at five levels –\nindividual patients and clinicians, Clinical Departments, Hospital, Area wide\nand State.	By 2011, they plan to have core clinical and corporate systems set up across NSW. This will help patients move through the healthcare system smoothly and ensure efficient management. Implementing the ICT Strategy will bring benefits to patients, clinicians, departments, hospitals, areas, and the whole state.	\N
15	Page 14	3.1 Benefits to the individual patient and clinician\nFrom a clinical perspective, the end-goal of the strategy is to achieve a\n‘single view of the patient’. The single view of the patient means that every\nclinician involved in the patients care (doctors, nurses, pharmacists,\nphysiotherapists etc…) have a full understanding of the patients complete\ncare needs and medical history. They can understand what other\npractitioners’ roles and contributions are and can work together effectively\nas a team across all parts of the system. Corporate systems are in place to\neffectively support the delivery of clinical care and support s single\nemployee view.	For patients and clinicians, the goal is to have a complete picture of the patient's health history. This way, all healthcare providers can work together effectively, knowing each other's roles and contributions. Corporate systems also support this by giving a clear view of employees, making sure care is delivered smoothly	\N
16	Page 14	The strategy benefits the patient as it means that all the information\nclinicians need to deliver the best possible care, with an optimal outcome is\neasily available whenever and wherever it is needed.\nThis helps clinicians by reducing the time they spend trying to locate\ninformation or unnecessarily repeating tests, increasing the time they have\navailable for direct patient care.	The strategy benefits patients by ensuring clinicians have all the information they need for optimal care, easily accessible whenever and wherever it's needed. This saves clinicians time by reducing the need to search for information or repeat tests unnecessarily, giving them more time for direct patient care.	\N
17	Page 15	For example a Nursing Unit Manager (NUM) on a ward can more effectively\nplan and care for patients with a full understanding of all demands, such as\npatients waiting in the ED, coming from surgery and being transferred in,\nand of ward capacity such as current available beds, pending available\nbeds, quarantined beds and staff availability and skills sets	Nursing Unit Manager (NUM) can plan patient care better when they know all the demands and resources. This includes patients from the emergency room, post-surgery, and transfers, as well as available beds and staff skills.	\N
18	Page 15	At Hospital, Area and Department executive levels, a complete portfolio\nallows an integrated analysis of health outcome indicators, demand for\nservices, resource availability, clinical and support services performance\nand financial management.	At hospital, area, and department executive levels, having a complete portfolio lets them look at health outcomes, service demand, resources, performance, and finances all together.	\N
19	Page 15	The ICT Strategy is focused on the priority areas or activities required to\nunderpin these and will be addressing them in its forward strategy as\nresources and funding become available. Other initiatives will only be\nadded to the ICT work plan if they do not compromise delivery of these\ncore functions, or to address an urgent issue.	The ICT Strategy focuses on key areas and will address them as resources allow. Other initiatives will only be added if they don't affect these core functions or if there's an urgent need.	\N
20	Page 15	3.2 Department level benefits\nBy 2011 clinical departments will have access to systems that improve work\nflow within the Department, provide decision support for clinicians and\naccess to information needed to support the most effective management of\nresources. This will mean that clinicians will have immediate access to\ncritical information to make sure that the right decisions are made for\npatients. This, combined with rules built into clinical systems and better\ncommunication between staff in the department, will mean better and safer\ncare for patients	By 2011, clinical departments will have improved systems for workflow, decision-making support, and accessing necessary information. This helps clinicians make better decisions for patients, leading to safer care	\N
21	Page 15	3.3 Hospital level benefits The implementation of well integrated core systems across a hospital, including for\nexample Results Reporting, Order Management, Patient Administration Systems, Scheduling and Human\nResources means that information can be collected once and be accessible to all who need it. This will\nminimise problems at handover and allow enterprise wide management of human and other resources to increase efficiency and\nreduce access block as patient’s move between departments. Good\ninformation allows the patient journey to be more efficient allowing time to\nsee more patients.	Integrated hospital systems mean information is collected once and available to all, reducing handover issues and improving resource management for smoother patient care.	\N
22	Page 15/16	Information & Communication Technology (ICT) Strategy Where we want to be in 2011\n15\nFor example a Nursing Unit Manager (NUM) on a ward can more effectively\nplan and care for patients with a full understanding of all demands, such as\npatients waiting in the ED, coming from surgery and being transferred in,\nand of ward capacity such as current available beds, pending available\nbeds, quarantined beds and staff availability and skills sets.\nAt Hospital, Area and Department executive levels, a complete portfolio\nallows an integrated analysis of health outcome indicators, demand for\nservices, resource availability, clinical and support services performance\nand financial management.\nThe ICT Strategy is focused on the priority areas or activities required to\nunderpin these and will be addressing them in its forward strategy as\nresources and funding become available.

This will mean that clinicians will have immediate access to\ncritical information to make sure that the right decisions are made for\npatients. This, combined with rules built into clinical systems and better\ncommunication between staff in the department, will mean better and safer\ncare for patients.\n3.3 Hospital level benefits\nThe implementation of well\nintegrated core systems\nacross a hospital, including for\nexample Results Reporting,\nOrder Management, Patient\nAdministration Systems,\nScheduling and Human\nResources means that\ninformation can be collected\nonce and be accessible to all\nwho need it. This will\nminimise problems at\nhandover and allow enterprise\nwide management of human and other resources to increase efficiency and\nreduce access block as patient’s move between departments. Good\ninformation allows the patient journey to be more efficient allowing time to\nsee more patients.\n3.4 Area level benefits\nAreas will benefit from the implementation of these systems as they will\nhave access to standardised information from all facilities to manage their\nresources more effectively, support planning and demand management and\nmanagement of patient transfers between hospitals in their Area with\nInformation & Communication Technology (ICT) Strategy Where we want to be in 2011\n16\nminimum duplication of diagnostic procedures and delays for patients.\nImproved communication between hospitals and clinicians in the\ncommunity will support patient care better once they leave hospital and\nreduce the risk of readmission	The ICT Strategy aims to improve patient care by giving Nursing Unit Managers better information to plan and care for patients, helping hospital executives manage resources and performance, making it easier for departments to access important info and make decisions, integrating key systems across hospitals for smoother patient care, and standardizing information across regions to manage resources and patient transfers more effectively	\N
23	Page 16	3.5 State level benefits\nImplementation of core systems across NSW will deliver significant\nbenefits. While benefits are derived at each level, the full value of ICT will\nbe achieved when these systems are implemented across all Areas.\nStandardised clinical and corporate information, collected as a by product\nof patient care, provides support for NSW Health to achieve the targets set\nunder the Results and Services Plan by improving patient journeys across\nthe health system, improving timely access to services, strengthening co-\nordination and integration across the health system. Accurate information\nwill allow better utilisation of resources and management of future\ndemand.	Rolling out core systems across NSW will have big benefits. Everyone gains, but it's best when the whole state uses them. Standardized info will help NSW Health meet goals by improving patient care, ensuring timely access to services, and better coordination in the health system. Accurate data will help use resources better and manage future needs.	\N

There are many competing demands for ICT funds. Deciding which projects to prioritize and schedule is complex and needs ongoing review to ensure funds are allocated where they will be most beneficial.	\N
35	Page 18	When considered collectively, the convergence of issues creates an\nenvironment of significant risk that must be addressed. The only way NSW\nHealth can realistically meet these challenges is to change the way it\ndelivers services. NSW Health has embarked on a major clinical and\ncorporate reform program to address these issues. The implementation of\nappropriate IT solutions to support staff and embed business processes is\ncritical to ensuring this change is sustainable	NSW Health needs to change how it delivers services to meet these challenges. They've started a big reform program and need the right IT solutions to support staff and make these changes last	\N
36	Page 19	5 Strategic Response to Key Challenges\n5.1 NSW Health Strategic Framework\nThere are a number of key drivers that are influencing NSW Health\nstrategic directions. These relate to both the demand for health services,\ndriven by factors such as the aging population, and supply within health,\nfor example workforce shortages in key areas of the health system. The\nwider government priorities and directions, such as the Council of\nAustralian Government priorities around Mental Health and Health\nworkforce and whole of government ICT strategies also drive the strategic\ndirections and investment decisions of NSW Health	NSW Health is responding to big challenges like more people needing healthcare and not enough staff. They're looking at what the government wants, like improving mental health and using better technology. That helps them decide what to do next and where to spend money.	\N
37	Page 19	At the highest level, the Results and Services Plan sets the strategic\ndirections for all NSW Health Programs. This is supported by a number of\nstrategic programs aimed at delivering the Results and Services Plan.\nThe ICT Strategic Plan aims to support the Results and Services Plan by\nensuring close alignment with the reform programs and strategies\nunderpinning the Results and Services Plan. All levels of NSW Health\nplanning take into consideration the NSW whole of government and\nNational strategies	The Results and Services Plan guides everything in NSW Health. There are other plans helping out too. The ICT Strategic Plan is one of them, making sure it works well with the main plan. They also look at what the whole government and the country are doing.	\N
38	Page 20/21	5.2 Results and Services Plan (RSP)\nThe RSP represents NSW Health’s primary strategic response to the\nchallenges faced by NSW Health. NSW Health has four primary goals:\n1. To keep people healthy\n2. To provide the health care that people need\n3. To deliver high quality services\n4. To manage health services well\nThese are underpinned by seven key strategic directions:\n• Make prevention everybody’s business\n• Create better experiences for people using health services\n• Strengthen primary health and continuing care in the community\n• Build regional and other partnerships for health.\nMake smart choices about costs and benefits of health services\n• Build a sustainable the health workforce\n• Be ready for new risks and opportunities	The RSP is NSW Health's main plan to tackle challenges. They have four main goals:\nKeep people healthy\nProvide needed healthcare\nDeliver top-quality services\nManage health services well\n\nTo achieve these, they focus on seven key directions:\nGet everyone involved in prevention\nImprove people's healthcare experiences\nStrengthen community care\nWork with others for better health\nMake wise choices about healthcare costs\nBuild a strong healthcare workforce\nStay prepared for new challenges and chances	\N
39	Page 21	5.2.1 Strategic Goal 1: To keep people healthy\nReducing risk factors in the population is a major strategic objective for\nNSW Health. NSW Health is increasing the focus on health promotion and\npreventing illness and implementing strategies to increase immunisation\nrates, reduce the impact of chronic disease, reduce diabetes through\ninterventions for people at high risk. ICT can support many of these\nstrategies by providing automatic alerts about risk factors, such as gaps in\nimmunisations, or overdue screening or check ups.'	NSW Health wants to prevent sickness and promote good health habits. They're focusing on getting more people vaccinated and helping those at risk for diseases like diabetes. ICT can help by sending alerts about things like missed vaccinations or overdue check-ups	\N
40	Page 21/22	5.2.2 Strategic Goal 2 : To provide the healthcare people need\nHealth services need to be available when needed, are effective and co-\nordinated to meet each individual’s needs. ICT plays a major role in\nproviding the tools that are needed to underpin new models of care and\nmake clinical reform sustainable. Supporting information flow along the\npatient journey plays a large part in improving the experience of people as\nthey move along the journey, and making sure that the care they receive is\nappropriate	NSW Health wants to make sure everyone gets the care they need, when they need it. They're using tech to support new ways of caring for people and making sure changes stick. Better info during your care journey means a better experience and getting the right care.	\N
41	Page 23/24	5.2.3 Strategic Goal 3: To deliver high quality health services\nThere are currently three levels of government and multiple agencies\ninvolved in funding and delivering health services, resulting in complexity\nand duplication. Improved collaboration within and beyond the health\nsystem is vital to improve the links and improve co-ordination and the\nquality of services provided across the health system. ICT provides the\ninfrastructure and tools needed to improve this level of collaboration.\nQuality and safety will also be enhanced through decision support tools for\nclinicians through the Electronic Medical Record, and by more appropriate\nuse of resources through rostering and other HR tools.	NSW Health aims to improve healthcare by working better together. They're using tech to help everyone collaborate and use resources wisely. That means better tools for healthcare workers and making sure everyone gets great care.	\N
42	Page 24	5.3 NSW and National ICT Government Drivers\nThe NSW Government IT environment feeds into, and, to some extent,\nconstrains the NSW Health ICT strategic plan. This program aims to\nensure that NSW strategic initiatives align with, and where possible have\nthe opportunity to inform, national and broader state initiatives	The NSW Government's IT setup influences NSW Health's ICT plan. They aim to make sure NSW initiatives match up with and sometimes even help shape national and statewide plans	\N
43	Page 25	5.3.1 NSW GCIO ICT Strategic Plan\nThe NSW Government has set new directions for IT through the NSW\nGovernment CIO Executive Council. Primary goals include:\n• Using IT to reduce back-end service costs while maintaining frontline\nservices\n• Increasing investment in frontline service technologies\n• Delivering savings through IT strategies in both capital costs and\nrecurrent costs\n• Reducing the total cost of IT\nThe Government has proposed a number of new measures to achieve its\nprimary goals including:\n• A single capital fund for IT\n• A statewide IT plan\nA focus on fewer software applications, shared infrastructure, common\nprocesses and aggregated purchasing	The NSW Government is changing how they use computers and stuff. They want to save money on the boring tech stuff while keeping important services running smoothly. They're spending more on technology for important services and finding ways to save money with computers. This means using one fund for all tech needs, having a plan for the whole state, using fewer computer programs, sharing tech, and buying things together.	\N
44	Page 25	5.3.2 Council of Australian Governments\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has identified significant\nareas of national interest including mental health, health workforce, action\nplans for influenza pandemics and progress towards electronic health\nrecords. ICT is an enabler for many of the COAG priorities. COAG has an\nambitious health and ageing reform agenda proposed for implementation\nfrom 2009. This includes a program of hospital reform, improvements to\nIndigenous health, chronic disease management and preventative health\ncare. The ICT program outlined in this strategy directly supports the COAG\nreform agenda, through its focus on the implementation of systems that\nwill enable clinical reform in both acute and community settings.	COAG is a group working on important national stuff like mental health, healthcare workers, flu plans, and electronic health records. They're making big plans for healthcare, like making hospitals better and helping people stay healthy. This ICT plan is part of making those plans work by improving healthcare in hospitals and communities	\N

The eHealth initiative involves all states, territories, and the Australian Government. It began in 2000 to set up e-health across Australia. The Australian Government has invested $128 million in e-health projects across the country, plus an extra $10 million in 2005 for managed health network grants. The aim is to make sure everyone works together, with consistent approaches to eHealth, creating a national health information network. The program also helps make the right rules for eHealth initiatives.	\N
46	Page 26	5.3.4 NEHTA\nNEHTA’s primary goal is the development of national health information\nmanagement and communications technology standards and specifications.\nNEHTA is progressing a number of work programs that will have a direct\nimpact on NSW Health’s ICT strategic plan.\nThese include:\neHealth interoperability: developing a Framework for Interoperability to\nenable efficient and secure electronic exchange of information between\nhealth organisations.\nClinical communications: NEHTA is undertaking a program of\nstandardisation of key clinical information. It is intended that the format\nof, and data contained in, clinical communications such as patient referrals\nand hospital discharge summaries will be standardised across all health IT\nsystems, according to the specifications set by NEHTA. These specifications\nwill be built upon existing standards, extending these as necessary. This\nwork includes the establishment of a common, coded clinical language\n(clinical terminology).\nUnique Healthcare Identifiers – This program is developing a single\nNational identifier for individuals accessing healthcare services, providers\nwithin the public and private healthcare systems and health organisations.\nAt least initially, the individual identifier is not expected to be used as the\nprimary identifier by most jurisdictions.\nIndividual Electronic Health Record: NEHTA are preparing the data\nand interoperability standards and business case for the development and\nimplementation of a national electronic health record.\nIdentity management: Standards to ensure the accurate identification\nand secure access of individuals to clinical information.\nSecure messaging: NEHTA is working to define national standards and\nshared infrastructure to ensure that the electronic exchange of clinical\ninformation between healthcare providers is reliable and secure.\nSupply chain: NEHTA has established a National Product Catalogue (NPC)\nto provide a central source of data for the purchase of healthcare products\nwithin health departments in each State and Territory.	focuses on developing national health information management and communication technology standards. Its work includes creating frameworks for interoperability, standardizing clinical communications, establishing unique healthcare identifiers, and preparing standards for individual electronic health records, identity management, secure messaging, and supply chain management.	\N
47	Page 27	6..1 Approach to delivery of ICT in NSW\nTo meet and prepare for the challenges it faces NSW Health is\nimplementing changes to the way it delivers services. NSW Health has\nembarked on a major combined clinical and corporate and ICT reform\nprogram to address these issues. Implementation of IT solutions to\nsupport staff and embed business processes is critical to ensuring change\nto delivery of services is sustainable	To tackle challenges and prepare for the future, NSW Health is changing how it delivers services. Implementing IT solutions to support staff and integrate business processes is key for sustainable service delivery changes.	\N
48	Page 27	Strategic Information Management (SIM)\nSIM is responsible for the development of ICT strategy, working with\nstakeholders to determine investment priorities, budget negotiation and\nensuring overall program delivery. SIM’s role includes:\n• Development and maintenance of the NSW ICT Strategic Plan and\ninvestment program\n• Interface with Area Health Services and other key stakeholder\ngroups\n• Business case development and review of Area IM&T proposals\n• overseeing the delivery of the IM&T strategy,\n• Ensuring compliance with government, Departmental and Branch\nstandards, architecture and policies\n• Identify, assess and address the enterprise architecture needs of\nNSW Health by developing and maintaining appropriate policies,\nstandards and procedures for information management.\n• Managing, planning and developing integration strategies,\narchitecture, standards and policies to enable effective and\nconsistent integration of a wide range of systems throughout NSW\nHealth.	NEHTA makes sure health info works the same way everywhere in Australia. They're working on stuff like making sure doctors' notes and patient info look the same everywhere. They're also setting up a single ID for healthcare and getting ready for a national health record system. Plus, they're making sure the stuff doctors send each other is safe, and helping with buying healthcare stuff	\N
49	Page 27	Health Support Services\nHealth Support Services is responsible for the implementation and ongoing\nsupport and maintenance of core clinical and corporate systems. Health\nSupport Services are responsible for providing specific clinical and\ncorporate IT services to the Area Health Services as defined under s126G\nof the Health Services Act 1997. This includes the provision of hardware\nand hardware asset management, software, application support systems\nand system implementation management.	Health Support Services sets up and maintains key computer systems for healthcare. They give specific IT help to Area Health Services as defined by the law. This includes managing computers, software, and helping with setting up systems.	\N

51	Page 31	6.2 Approach to delivery\nA portfolio management approach is used as the basis for prioritising,\nselecting and monitoring programs and projects and making sound\ninvestment decisions that provide the greatest benefit to the health system.\nIt is underpinned by common processes across ICT at a Departmental and\nArea level. The ICT portfolio is managed within a collaborative framework\nthat defines:\n• Processes to determine, develop and manage core, common and\ndivergent applications\n• Application of integrated governance models at Area Health Services\nand the Department\n• State based build approach to core applications to support a faster,\nmore cost effective implementation and to underpin predictable\nprocesses across the whole of NSW.	They pick the most important projects and invest wisely for the health system. We work together on ICT stuff and have clear rules. This helps us decide what to build and how to run things	\N
52	Page 31	What are the possible solutions that can be implemented to mitigate reaised concerns while maintaing the organizations values ?\nWhat are the possible solutions that can be implemented to mitigate raised concerns while maintaining the organizations values ?	NSW Health uses a coordinated approach to manage ICT projects. This helps us evaluate, prioritize, select, and monitor programs and projects. We adjust as needed to meet our business goals.	\N
53	Page 32	6.4 Standard processes adopted across the ICT portfolio\nCore processes and standard guidelines for operation underpin the delivery\nof the ICT Strategic Plan. The processes relate to the stages of the project\nlifecycle, while the guidelines identified in the diagram below apply to the\nportfolio as a whole and to individual projects within the portfolio. Details\nfor each of these processes, guidelines and templates can be found on the\nSIM website at http://internal.health.nsw.gov.au/sim	They have set ways of doing things that support our ICT plan. These cover every step of a project's life.	\N
54	Page 33	6.5 A framework for Partnership\nFor NSW Health to effectively implement this strategy it must be done as a\ncollaboration between the Department of Health, Area Health Services,\nHealth Technology and third party providers.\nThere are three key components of the collaboration framework. These\nare:\n• Processes to determine, develop and manage core, common and\ndivergent applications;\n• Application of integrated governance models at AHSs and the\nDepartment;\n• State based build approach to core applications to support a faster,\nmore cost effective implementation and to underpin predictable\nprocesses across the whole of NSW	To make the strategy work, NSW Health collaborates with the Department of Health, Area Health Services, Health Technology, and third-party providers, using shared decision-making processes and building core applications at the state level	\N
55	Page 33	6.5.1 Core, Common and Divergent\nAll applications and associated projects are classified as core, common or\ndivergent. This classification will influence how each project will be\nprioritised, governed, funded, procured, implemented and managed.\nCore: Applications and projects that are expected to provide all\nstate wide core functions. These will be directed,\ncontrolled and funded by the Department.\nCommon: These applications provide common solutions across a\ncollaborative group. They will be controlled collaboratively\nto achieve the desired outcomes for the group.\nDivergent: Applications aimed at innovative solutions to localised\ngroups to enable design flexibility to explore new solutions\nto specific requirements	Applications and projects are categorized as core, common, or divergent, influencing their prioritization, funding, and management, with core ones managed by the Department, common ones collaboratively, and divergent ones allowing for innovative solutions to local needs.	\N
56	Page 34/35	The purpose of the Project Governance framework is to ensure that\nprojects remain relevant and deliver the stated business benefits. Effective\ngovernance should ensure both that the NSW Health focuses on “doing the\nright projects”, and that the right people focus on “doing the projects\nright”. The governance structure is intended to reduce the risk to the\nportfolio that would occur if there were to be a complete disconnect\nbetween strategy and delivery.	The Project Governance framework makes sure projects do what they're supposed to and deliver the benefits they promised. It helps NSW Health focus on the right projects and ensures they're done correctly. This way, strategy and delivery stay connected, reducing risks for the whole portfolio	\N
57	Page 36	1. Content Development\nThis phase is characterised by an intense design and build of a prototype,\nfollowed by a series of clinical review sessions. A methodology for the\ndesign and build of SBB content has previously been developed and\nutilised. The Fast Track methodology leverages this approach and adds in\nthe more efficient prototype model. The prototype assists clinicians in\ngaining a better understanding of the application and offers the opportunity\nto view the process as part of an integrated workflow. This approach\nfacilitates informed decision-making.	In the Content Development phase, they design and build a prototype, then review it with clinicians. We use a method called Fast Track, which makes the process quicker. The prototype helps clinicians understand the application better and decide if it works for them	\N
58	Page 36/37	2. Implementation\nThe implementation phase is designed around the State defined content.\nAlthough this introduces a large amount of content in a single project, it\nachieves greater benefit and is more cost effective. The Fast Track Metho\nreduces the time, cost and complexity of implementation by using a\nstandard design with State Build content. Resource constraints and the\nextended learning curve to get AHS staff up to speed that were an inherent\npart of the old methodology, are minimised by the new approach. The\nimplementation team assigned to the project have the application\nknowledge to build the database. A rapid implementation also eliminates\nthe inevitable scope creep that occurs during any long IT project.	In the Implementation phase, they're putting in the content decided by the state. Doing it all at once might seem like a lot, but it's the most efficient and cost-effective way. Using the Fast Track Method makes things quicker and cheaper, sticking to a standard design with state content. This means less hassle and less time spent learning for Area Health Services staff. Their team knows how to build the database, and doing things fast helps them stick to the plan without adding extra stuff.	\N
66	Page 44	7.4.2 Programs supporting this strategy\nThe infrastructure strategy incorporates the following programs:\nInfrastructure Defining and implementing the\ntelecommunications and technical infrastructure\nto support the clinical and corporate strategies.\nArchitecture and\nStandards\nProviding the enterprise architecture enterprise\nintegration layer and core technical standards\nrequired to manage NSW information assets.\nInformation\nmanagement\nEnsuring that uniform data standards are\ndeveloped and applied across state based builds\nand other systems as appropriate and that data\nquality strategies are in place to ensure\nmaximum value from the information collected\nacross NSW.	The Sustainable Infrastructure program includes three parts: setting up infrastructure, establishing technical standards, and ensuring uniform data standards across systems in NSW.	\N
59	Page 37/38	3. SBB Maturity Model\nThe SBB uses a maturity model to progressively enhance the functionality\nof the application as the experience and expectations of users increase.\nThe maturity model is based on the following principles:\n• All Area Health Services contribute to the development of each version\nof the SBB.\n• Version 1.0 of any application is implemented as the SBB.\nEnhancements can be proposed by any Area Health Service, but must\nbe endorsed by the majority of members of the Application Advisory\nGroup (AAG).\n• Every Area Health Service has equal weight in the AAG.\n• Every proposed change must go through a formal change control\nprocess and be reviewed by the AAG, even those that are specific to\none Area (eg establishing the facility codes for hospitals in that Area).\n• The primary function of the AAG is to consider and endorse changes\nfor each version of the SBB. New versions will be released on an\nannual basis.\nSBB functionality can be classified as:\n• Required core: required content and functionality to support common\nbusiness and application functions, including standardised KPIs and\nreporting and a consistent user interface for mobile staff. Required\ncontent must be consistent across all implementations.\n• Modifiable within guidelines to support area specific clinical processes,\nassessments and third party applications\n• Localised content where site specific information is required in the build\n(eg code table for local facilities)	The SBB uses a maturity model to improve its features over time, with all Area Health Services contributing to each version, changes requiring approval from the majority of the Application Advisory Group, and new versions released annually, featuring required core functions, modifiable features, and local content.	\N
60	Page 39	Information & Communication Technology (ICT) Strategy Priority ICT strategies\n39\n7 Priority ICT strategies\nThe ICT Strategy has been realigned with the core reform strategies of\nClinical Services Redesign and Corporate Shared Services. Five major ICT\nstrategies have been defined to support the broader strategic priorities.\nThese are the Clinical Systems Strategy, the Corporate Systems Strategy,\nBusiness Information Strategy, Sustainable Infrastructure strategy and\nWhole of Government ICT Strategic directions.\nThis section outlines:\n• the initiatives that are being delivered in this stage of the ICT\nStrategic Plan (2006-2011)\n• initiatives scheduled for the second phase of the 10 year plan,\nbetween 2012 and 2016.\n7.1 Clinical Systems Strategy\n7.1.1 Objective\nThe Clinical Systems Strategy will implement the core clinical systems\nneeded to underpin the Clinical Services Redesign Program, Quality and\nSafety initiatives and clinical program areas.\nThe focus will be on systems to improve communication, minimise delays,\nreduce handover problems and support the patient journey. Systems will\nsupport the flexible allocation of resources to ensure services meet patient\nneeds.	The Clinical Systems Strategy aims to implement essential clinical systems supporting Clinical Services Redesign, Quality and Safety initiatives, and clinical programs. It focuses on improving communication, reducing delays, and supporting patient care, ensuring resources are allocated flexibly to meet patient needs	\N
61	Page 39	7.1.2 Programs supporting this strategy\nThree programs support the Clinical Systems Strategy. These are:\n• Electronic Medical Record program to implement the core\ndepartmental systems needed to manage patients effectively in an\nacute environment.\n• Primary, Community and Outpatient Care program to implement\nthe infrastructure and systems to support patient care in the\ncommunity, outpatient and primary care environment. It includes\nreferrals and interaction with other human services, and the pilot for\nthe Electronic Health Record program.\n• Clinical Support program to implement core support systems such\nas Patient Administration systems and diagnostic systems.	Three programs support the Clinical Systems Strategy: the Electronic Medical Record program for managing patients in hospitals, the Primary, Community, and Outpatient Care program for community care, and the Clinical Support program for essential support systems like Patient Administration and diagnostics.	\N
62	Page 42	7.2 Corporate Systems Strategy\n7.2.1 Objective\nThe Corporate Systems Strategy will implement the core systems needed\nto underpin the Corporate Shared Services reform program. This program\naims to reduce the duplication and cost in administrative functions to\nincrease funds available for frontline care. This strategy is underpinned by\nthe Corporate Systems program.	The Corporate Systems Strategy sets up essential systems to support the Corporate Shared Services reform program, cutting duplication and costs in administrative tasks to redirect funds to frontline care, with the Corporate Systems program as its backbone.	\N
63	Page 43	7.3 Business Information Strategy\n7.3.1 Objectives\nThe Business Information Strategy aims to make a core set of high quality\ninformation available at all levels of the organisation in a timely manner\nand to develop a performance culture around it. This has the potential to\ntransform operational data into management insight, and support decisions\nthat drive real results for the Department and its stakeholders. Business\ninformation must integrate NSW health’s strategic objectives with front line\nservice delivery, drive management accountability and be driven by the\noverall program and change management approach	The Business Information Strategy aims to provide timely, high-quality information throughout the organization, fostering a performance-driven culture. It helps turn data into insights, supports decision-making, aligns with strategic goals, ensures accountability, and follows the overall program and change management approach.	\N
64	Page 43	7.3.2 Programs supporting this strategy\nThere are three major programs under the Business Information Strategy.\nThese are:\nCreate value for\ndecision makers at\nthe front line\nThe primary aim of this program is to provide\ntimely, relevant information in a user friendly way\nto clinicians and decision makers in front line\nservices.\nGovernance and\nperformance\nmanagement\nAimed at integrating NSW Health’s strategic and\nplanning frameworks and developing overall\nvalue and cost effectiveness performance\nmeasures.\nEnabling\ninfrastructure and\nsupport\nMaking sure that the source systems are capable\nof providing the major indicators, that the data\nsets are standardised and implemented to\nprovide consistent information and the technical\ninfrastructure is in place	Three programs support the Business Information Strategy: one delivers useful information to front-line staff, another integrates strategic frameworks and develops performance measures, and the third ensures systems can provide consistent data and sets up technical infrastructure	\N
65	Page 44	7.4 Sustainable infrastructure program\n7.4.1 Objectives\nThis program aims to rationalise the technical infrastructure and develop\nand maintain standards and architecture needed to support state wide ICT\ninitiatives and to ensure the maximum benefit is gained from the\ninvestment in ICT.	The Sustainable Infrastructure program aims to streamline technical infrastructure, establish and uphold standards and architecture for statewide ICT initiatives, and ensure maximum benefit from ICT investments.	\N
